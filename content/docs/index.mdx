# Welcome to Dorkroom Documentation

Photography reference documentation and guides for analog photographers.

Dorkroom is a comprehensive collection of photography calculators and reference materials designed to help you master the art and science of analog photography. Use these docs to understand film characteristics, chemistry, and proven workflows so you can stay focused on making prints.

## Getting Started

Explore the documentation sections to learn about different aspects of film photography:

- **Film Information** — Technical data and characteristics of popular film stocks.
- **Developer Information** — Chemistry specifications, dilution options, and development times.
- **Development Recipes** — Proven film and developer combinations with repeatable results.
- **Photography Guides** — Tutorials and best practices for the darkroom and on-location shooting.

## Quick Links

Need to jump directly into the tools? Use the calculators in the main app to help with:

- **Exposure Calculator** — Balance aperture, shutter speed, and ISO for perfect exposures.
- **Reciprocity Calculator** — Correct for long exposure failure across different film stocks.
- **Border Calculator** — Create trim-safe print borders for common sizes.
- **Resize Calculator** — Scale prints accurately without guesswork.
- **Development Recipes** — Find compatible film and chemistry pairings with detailed instructions.

## How to Contribute

These docs live alongside the rest of the open-source project. If you see something missing—or have a workflow other photographers should know—open a pull request or start a discussion on GitHub. Every shared note helps another person make a better print.
