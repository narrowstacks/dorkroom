## Getting Started with Film Photography

### Choosing Your First Film Camera

Starting your film photography journey begins with selecting the right camera:

#### 35mm Film Cameras

- **SLR Cameras:** Canon AE-1, Nikon FM2, Pentax K1000 — versatile with interchangeable lenses
- **Point and Shoot:** Olympus Stylus Epic, Yashica T4 — compact, excellent lenses, automatic operation
- **Rangefinders:** Canonet QL17, Olympus 35RC — quiet shutters perfect for street work

#### Medium Format Cameras

- **Twin-Lens Reflex (TLR):** Rolleiflex, Yashica Mat — waist-level viewing, square format
- **SLR:** Mamiya 645, Bronica SQ — larger negatives, interchangeable backs
- **Folding Cameras:** Zeiss Ikonta, Agfa Isolette — portable with classic rendering

### Understanding Film Basics

#### Film Speed (ISO)

- **ISO 100–200:** Bright daylight, fine grain, maximum quality
- **ISO 400:** Most versatile, handles varied lighting conditions
- **ISO 800+:** Low-light situations—expect additional grain

#### Color vs. Black & White

- **Black & White Film:** Emphasises composition, texture, and contrast; easy to process at home
- **Color Film:** Captures reality as we see it but needs C-41 or E-6 chemistry
- **Slide Film:** Positive images with extremely tight exposure latitude

## Exposure Techniques

### The Exposure Triangle

Film photography requires balancing:

- **Aperture** for depth of field and light intake
- **Shutter Speed** for motion control and exposure time
- **ISO** which is fixed once a roll is loaded

### Zone System Basics

Developed by Ansel Adams to visualise tonal placement:

- **Zone 0:** Pure black (no detail)
- **Zone V:** Middle gray (18% reflectance)
- **Zone X:** Pure white (no detail)
- Expose for shadows, develop for highlights

### Metering Techniques

#### Incident Metering

- Measure light falling on the subject
- Offers the most consistent results
- Hold the meter at the subject pointing back to the camera

#### Reflected Metering

- Measures light bouncing off the subject
- Built-in camera meters work this way
- Can be fooled by very bright or dark scenes

#### Zone System Metering

- Measure key shadow areas
- Place them around Zone III (dark but detailed)
- Adjust exposure accordingly

## Composition and Artistic Techniques

### Classic Composition Rules

#### Rule of Thirds

- Divide the frame into a 3×3 grid
- Place important elements along the grid intersections
- Creates dynamic, pleasing compositions

#### Leading Lines

- Use roads, rivers, fences, or architecture to guide the viewer’s eye
- Adds depth and visual flow

#### Framing

- Frame the subject with doorways, arches, foliage, or architectural elements
- Provides context and depth

### Lighting Considerations

#### Natural Light

- **Golden Hour:** Warm, soft light that flatters skin tones
- **Blue Hour:** Cool, dramatic hues—great for cityscapes
- **Overcast:** Soft, shadowless light perfect for portraits
- **Harsh Midday:** Hard shadows and contrast; plan compositions carefully

#### Artificial Light

- **Window Light:** Soft and directional, ideal for portraiture
- **Flash:** Use fill flash to balance bright backgrounds
- **Available Light:** Neon, street lamps, and interior fixtures create mood

## Film-Specific Techniques

### Long Exposures

#### Reciprocity Failure

Most emulsions need additional exposure during long exposures:

- 1–10 seconds: add roughly 0.5–1 stop
- 10–100 seconds: add 1–2 stops
- 100+ seconds: add 2+ stops or switch films

#### Neutral Density Filters

- Enable long exposures in daylight
- Help create motion blur in water, clouds, and crowds
- Allow shallow depth of field on bright days

### Pushing and Pulling Film

#### When to Push

- Low light or indoor available-light scenes
- Desire for gritty, high-contrast renderings
- Faster shutter speeds needed for action

#### When to Pull

- Extremely bright conditions or high-contrast scenes
- Desire for smoother highlights and lower contrast
- Softer, pastel renditions

### Multiple Exposures

- Use cameras with in-built multiple-exposure features or rewind carefully between frames
- Keep backgrounds dark to avoid blown highlights
- Underexpose each frame by about 1 stop when combining two exposures

## Darkroom and Processing

### Home Processing Basics

#### Equipment Checklist

- Changing bag or light-tight darkroom
- Developing tank and reels
- Developer, stop bath, fixer, and wetting agent
- Thermometer, measuring graduates, and timer
- Drying clips and dust-free hanging space

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. Load film onto reels in complete darkness
2. Develop according to time/temperature for your recipe
3. Stop bath to halt development
4. Fixer to make the image permanent
5. Wash thoroughly for at least 20 minutes
6. Apply wetting agent and hang to dry

### Scanning Film

#### Digital Options

- **Dedicated Film Scanners:** Maximum quality, higher cost
- **Flatbed Scanners:** Versatile and affordable for 120 and 4×5
- **DSLR Scanning:** High resolution with camera + macro lens setup
- **Lab Scanning:** Outsourced convenience with pro quality

#### Scanning Tips

- Clean negatives carefully before each scan
- Use 2400–4800 DPI for 35 mm output
- Save masters as TIFF or DNG
- Consider multi-pass scanning for dense slides

## Advanced Topics

### Large Format Photography

#### Benefits

- Exceptional resolving power and tonal control
- Perspective movements for precise focus
- Individual sheet development for experimentation
- Encourages a slower, intentional workflow

#### Movements to Learn

- **Rise/Fall:** Vertical perspective control
- **Shift:** Horizontal perspective control
- **Tilt/Swing:** Adjusts focal plane via Scheimpflug principle

### Alternative Processes

- **Cyanotype:** Iron-based blue prints cured under UV light
- **Platinum/Palladium:** Noble-metal prints with unmatched archival stability

### Documentary Photography

#### Approach

- Build relationships and trust with subjects
- Tell stories through sequences, not just single frames
- Consider ethics and representation throughout the project

#### Technical Notes

- ISO 400 film provides flexibility for most environments
- Focus on decisive moments and environmental context
- Mix close portraits with detail shots for narrative depth

## Best Practices

### Camera Care

- Store gear in a dry, temperature-stable environment
- Service mechanical shutters and meters periodically
- Keep batteries fresh even in mostly mechanical bodies
- Clean lenses using blower, brush, and microfiber cloths

### Film Storage

- Refrigerate or freeze sealed film for longevity
- Let cold film acclimate to room temperature before shooting
- Test expired stock before mission-critical work

### Continuous Learning

- Study master photographers and contemporary artists alike
- Join workshops, clubs, or online communities
- Keep detailed exposure + development notes
- Embrace mistakes—they accelerate learning

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Focus Issues

- Soft images may come from misfocus or dirty optics
- Use faster shutter speeds or tripods to avoid camera shake
- Test different apertures to evaluate lens sharpness

### Exposure Problems

- Underexposed: give more light or verify meter accuracy
- Overexposed: reduce exposure and mind bright scenes
- Contrast issues: adjust development or choose different film

### Processing Problems

- Fogging: inspect for light leaks and ensure darkroom safety
- Uneven development: refine agitation rhythm and solution levels
- Chemical issues: mix fresh chemistry at correct temperatures
