NOTICE

This file contains project-specific interpretations and additional information
regarding the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) as it
applies to the Dorkroom project. This is NOT part of the official license
text and should not be considered legal advice.

PROJECT-SPECIFIC INTERPRETATION OF AGPLv3

Dorkroom is a collection of specialized calculators and tools designed for
analog photographers and darkroom enthusiasts, available at https://dorkroom.art.
We believe the AGPLv3 provides the best balance between giving you the freedom
to use, study, and build upon Dorkroom while ensuring that improvements to the
project remain available to the community.

For your convenience, we have included our own interpretation of how the license
applies to Dorkroom. Quoted words refer to terms defined within the license text
to avoid ambiguity.

Our interpretation of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3:

1. You must always provide the source code, copyright, and license information
   of Dorkroom whenever you "convey" any part of Dorkroom, whether it is a
   verbatim copy or a modified copy.

2. If you deploy a modified version of Dorkroom on a network server, you must
   make the complete corresponding source code of your modified version
   available to users who interact with it remotely, as required by Section 13
   of the AGPLv3. This is the key distinction between the AGPLv3 and the
   standard GPLv3.

3. Dorkroom is a standalone web application. The following should be understood
   about how its license interacts with other works:

   a) If you use Dorkroom's source code as part of a larger work without
   modifying Dorkroom itself, and the two components remain separate and
   independent works, your work may qualify as an "aggregate" under the
   license and would not be bound by the AGPLv3 terms.

   b) If you have "modified", "adapted", or "extended" Dorkroom, then those
   modifications, extensions, or adaptations are considered "based on"
   Dorkroom and must be licensed under the AGPLv3.

4. Film development data (recipes, development times, and related information)
   displayed by Dorkroom may be freely reproduced in any form. The AGPLv3
   applies to the software itself, not to factual data.

5. Dorkroom provides a public REST API for accessing film and developer data.
   Simply consuming this API from your own application (i.e. making HTTP
   requests to Dorkroom's endpoints and using the returned data) does not
   make your application a "modified version" of or "based on" Dorkroom.
   Your application's interaction with the API is at arm's length, so the
   AGPLv3 obligations do not extend to your code. You are, however, still
   bound by any applicable terms of service and rate limits for the API
   itself.

We hope this interpretation aligns with your values and goals. If you have any
questions about the licensing of Dorkroom, you can:
