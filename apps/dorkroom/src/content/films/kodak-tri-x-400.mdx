## Characteristics

### Grain Structure

Tri-X has a classic, pleasing grain structure that becomes more pronounced when pushed. At box speed (ISO 400), the grain is moderate and contributes to the film's character without being distracting.

### Tonality

This film is known for its excellent tonal range with smooth gradation from shadows to highlights. It handles high-contrast scenes well and maintains detail in both bright and dark areas.

### Latitude

Tri-X is forgiving with exposure, accepting significant over-exposure and handling under-exposure reasonably well. It can be rated from ISO 200 to ISO 3200 with appropriate development.

## Usage Notes

### Recommended Uses

- Street photography
- Photojournalism
- Documentary work
- Portrait photography
- Low-light situations
- General purpose black and white photography

### Exposure Recommendations

- **Box speed**: ISO 400 provides a good balance of grain and tonality
- **Pushing**: Easily pushes to ISO 800, 1600, or even 3200
- **Pulling**: Can be rated at ISO 200 or 320 for finer grain

### Reciprocity Failure

Tri-X 400 starts to lose speed beyond about 1 second. Kodak recommends:

- Metered 1 second → expose 2 seconds (+1 stop), then reduce development ~10%
- Metered 10 seconds → expose 50 seconds (+2 stops), then reduce development ~20%
- Metered 100 seconds → expose 1200 seconds (+3 stops), then reduce development ~30%

Always consult the Kodak 400TX data sheet for the latest reciprocity and development guidance.

## Popular Development Combinations

Some tried-and-true developer combinations:

1. **D-76** (Stock or 1+1) - Classic combination, smooth tonality
2. **HC-110** (Dilution B) - Increased sharpness, slightly more grain
3. **Rodinal** (1+25 to 1+50) - Enhanced grain and sharpness
4. **XTOL** (Stock or 1+1) - Fine grain with good speed retention
5. **Microphen** - For pushing to higher ISOs

## Tips for Best Results

- Meter for the shadows and let the highlights fall where they may
- Consider pushing to ISO 800 for street photography
- Use a yellow or red filter for dramatic skies
