# Welcome to the Infobase

The Dorkroom Infobase is a collection of community-driven resources for film photography. It includes information on film stocks, developers, recipes, and guides.

The goal of the Infobase is to provide a centralized location for reliable and accessible information for film photographers of all levels.

You can browse the different sections using the navigation on the left. If you would like to contribute, please see the [contribution guide](/infobase/guides/contributing).
