## Available Dilutions

D-76 is typically used at three main dilutions:

- **Stock**: Undiluted for maximum film speed and finest grain
- **1+1**: One part developer to one part water for slightly increased sharpness and better economy
- **1+3**: For greater sharpness with some increase in grain

## Mixing Instructions

1. Heat water to 125°F (52°C)
2. Add chemicals in order while stirring:
   - Metol
   - Sodium sulfite
   - Hydroquinone
   - Borax
3. Add cold water to make 1 gallon (3.8L)
4. Cool to working temperature (68°F/20°C)

## Development Characteristics

### Development Type

D-76 is a metol-hydroquinone (MQ) developer that provides:

- Fine to moderate grain structure
- Excellent tonal range
- Good shadow detail
- Normal to slightly high contrast

### Recommended Films

D-76 works well with virtually all black and white films, particularly:

- Kodak Tri-X 400
- Kodak T-Max 400
- Ilford HP5 Plus
- Ilford FP4 Plus
- Fomapan films

## Storage and Handling

### Storage Requirements

- Store in tightly closed amber glass or plastic bottles
- Full bottles: 6 months at 68°F (20°C)
- Partially full bottles: 2 months
- Keep away from light and heat

### Working Solution Life

- **Stock solution**: Use within 24 hours of mixing for consistent results
- **Replenished**: Can be replenished for extended use
- **One-shot**: Discard after single use when diluted

### Safety Notes

- Wear gloves when handling chemicals
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- Follow manufacturer's safety data sheet (SDS)

## Development Tips

- Use stock solution for maximum film speed
- 1+1 dilution provides better economy and slightly increased sharpness
- Maintain consistent temperature (68°F/20°C) for predictable results
- Agitate consistently - initial 30 seconds, then 5 seconds every 30 seconds
- Can be used with stand development techniques at high dilutions

## Comparison with Other Developers

- **vs HC-110**: D-76 produces finer grain, HC-110 is sharper
- **vs XTOL**: Similar characteristics, XTOL may preserve highlights better
- **vs Rodinal**: D-76 produces much finer grain, Rodinal is sharper
