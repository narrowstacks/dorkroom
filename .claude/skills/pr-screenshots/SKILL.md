description: Capture before/after screenshots of visual changes and attach them to a PR. Use when opening a PR, or when asked to "add screenshots to the PR", "show what this looks like", "prove the UI change works", or "document this visually". Any PR that changes rendered output — a route, a shared component, a theme token, or a calculator's displayed result — needs these. Screenshots are uploaded to GitHub's CDN, never committed to the repo.

# PR Screenshots

A reviewer reading a diff has to imagine the result. Screenshots mean they don't
have to — and they catch the regressions a diff hides: a value that now renders
`NaN`, a card that lost its padding, a theme where the text went invisible.

Two pieces do the work:

- `scripts/pr-screenshots.ts` — captures a **shot list** against a running dev
  server, writes WebP files.
- `gh pr edit --attach` — uploads those files to GitHub's CDN and rewrites the
  local paths in the PR body to permanent `user-attachments/assets/…` URLs.
  Nothing lands in the repo.

`--attach` needs **gh 2.99.0 or newer**. Check with `gh --version` and upgrade
with `brew upgrade gh` before starting. On older gh the flag does not exist and
the command fails with `unknown flag: --attach`.

## Step 1 — Decide whether the change is visual

**Visual** if the diff touches any of:

- `apps/dorkroom/src/**` — routes, components, styles
- `packages/ui/**` — shared components, theme tokens
- a calculator in `packages/logic/**` whose result is *displayed*:
  `use-*-calculator.ts`, `use-light-meter-solver.ts`, `border-calculator/`

**Not visual** if the diff only touches `api/`, `packages/api/**`, tests,
configs, docs, or CI.

If it isn't visual, say so in the PR description — one line, e.g. *"No rendered
output changes; no screenshots."* Don't just omit the section, or a reviewer
can't tell whether it was considered or forgotten.

## Step 2 — Map the diff to routes, write the shot list

Routes live in `apps/dorkroom/src/routes/` and map 1:1 to paths
(`reciprocity.tsx` → `/reciprocity`). For a changed shared component or logic
hook, grep for its consumers — every route that renders it is affected.

**Default matrix: desktop × dark, one shot per affected route.** Widen only for
cause:

| Diff touches | Add |
|---|---|
| layout / responsive classes | a `mobile` shot |
| theme tokens, colors, a theme's stylesheet | a shot in *that* theme (not all four) |
| an error path, or output that needs specific inputs | an `actions` block |

Themes are `light`, `dark`, `darkroom`, `high-contrast`. There is no `system` —
a screenshot must be deterministic.

Write the list to `.pr-screenshots/shots.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "shots": [
    // Bare route. Calculators have sensible defaults, so this already renders
    // a real calculation — no actions needed.
    { "id": "reciprocity", "route": "/reciprocity" },

    // A driven state, for an error path or specific inputs.
    {
      "id": "reciprocity-negative",
      "route": "/reciprocity",
      "actions": [
        { "fill": "#duration", "value": "-5" },
        { "waitFor": "[role=alert]" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields: `id` (required — becomes the filename and the image's alt text), `route`
(required), `viewport` (`desktop` | `mobile`, default `desktop`), `theme`
(default `dark`), `actions` (optional: `fill`, `click`, `select`, `waitFor`).

Keep it tight. Three or four shots that show the change beat twelve that bury
it. One `gh` command takes at most **50 attachments**, which is far more than
any honest shot list.

## Step 3 — Capture "after"

**Never hardcode the dev server's port.** `@vercel/microfrontends` assigns it
(4503 at time of writing, not the 4200 in `vite.config.ts`) and increments when
that port is taken, so `PORT=…` does *not* override it. Always read the port
back from the server's own output:

```bash
bun run dev > /tmp/dr-after.log 2>&1 &
until grep -q 'Local:' /tmp/dr-after.log; do sleep 1; done
AFTER=$(grep -o 'http://localhost:[0-9]*' /tmp/dr-after.log | head -1)

bun run scripts/pr-screenshots.ts .pr-screenshots/shots.json \
  --base-url "$AFTER" --out-dir .pr-screenshots/after
```

If a shot fails here, the shot list is wrong — a bad selector, a route that
doesn't exist. Fix it; don't ship a PR with a missing screenshot.

## Step 4 — Capture "before"

The "before" state is the merge-base, not your working tree. Get it from a
worktree, which never touches your working tree — no stashing, nothing to lose.

**Stop the "after" server first.** The two dev servers cannot run side by side:
the microfrontends proxy claims a fixed port and dies with `Microfrontends proxy
error: Port is not available` rather than picking another one. (Bare `vite` does
increment — `bun run dev` doesn't, because the proxy is in front of it.)

```bash
pkill -f 'turbo run dev'          # free the port before starting the second server

BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
git worktree add --detach /tmp/dr-before "$BASE"
(cd /tmp/dr-before && bun install && bun run dev > /tmp/dr-before.log 2>&1 &)
until grep -q 'Local:' /tmp/dr-before.log; do sleep 1; done
BEFORE=$(grep -o 'http://localhost:[0-9]*' /tmp/dr-before.log | head -1)

bun run scripts/pr-screenshots.ts .pr-screenshots/shots.json \
  --base-url "$BEFORE" --out-dir .pr-screenshots/before

pkill -f 'turbo run dev'
git worktree remove --force /tmp/dr-before
```

**Always remove the worktree**, including when capture fails.

Two things to know:

- **A failed "before" shot is often correct.** A route or selector that doesn't
  exist at the merge-base means the UI is *new*. Read
  `.pr-screenshots/before/manifest.json`, confirm the failure is "this didn't
  exist yet", and give that shot an after-only entry in the table.
- **Shortcut:** if the PR's base is `main`, `--base-url https://dorkroom.art`
  captures "before" from production and skips the worktree install entirely —
  by far the slowest step. Only valid when `main` is deployed and current.

## Step 5 — Write the Screenshots section

Write the section with **Markdown image syntax pointing at the local files**.
`gh` rewrites those paths to CDN URLs on upload. Group by route, and put the
shot that best shows the change first:

```markdown
## Screenshots

### `/reciprocity` — desktop, dark

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| ![reciprocity before](.pr-screenshots/before/reciprocity.webp) | ![reciprocity after](.pr-screenshots/after/reciprocity.webp) |
```

New UI has no before — use a single **After** column and say the route is new.

**Markdown syntax only.** `gh` rewrites `![alt](path)` and nothing else. An HTML
`<img src="./shot.webp">` is left untouched — you get a broken image *and* the
file appended a second time at the bottom of the body. This is the one rule that
silently produces a wrong PR, so don't reach for `<img>` to set a width. A
two-column table already constrains each image to half the body width, which is
the only sizing the old flow was buying.

`gh pr edit --body-file` replaces the whole body, so build the new body from the
current one:

```bash
PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
gh pr view "$PR" --json body -q .body > /tmp/dr-body.md
cat .pr-screenshots/section.md >> /tmp/dr-body.md
```

## Step 6 — Upload and embed, in one command

Pass every screenshot as a repeated `--attach`. Each value is
`<path>#<alt text>`; without the `#` part the filename becomes the alt text.

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --body-file /tmp/dr-body.md \
  --attach '.pr-screenshots/before/reciprocity.webp#reciprocity before' \
  --attach '.pr-screenshots/after/reciprocity.webp#reciprocity after'
```

One command, all files, no browser and no session to keep alive. Then read the
body back and confirm every path became a CDN URL:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json body -q .body | grep -c 'user-attachments/assets'
```

Rules that matter in practice:

- **Every attached file must be referenced in the body.** An unreferenced
  attachment is not an error — it gets appended to the bottom of the body, out
  of its table. If you see a stray image below the section, that's a path that
  didn't match.
- **Path forms are normalized**, so `./shot.webp` in the body matches
  `shot.webp` in the flag and vice versa. Subdirectories work fine.
- **Alt text in the body wins.** `--attach 'x.webp#flag alt'` referenced as
  `![body alt](x.webp)` keeps *body alt*. The `#alt` only applies to
  attachments the body doesn't reference.
- **A file can be attached only once per command** (`… are the same file;
  attached files must be unique`). If one screenshot belongs in two places,
  reference it once and link to it in the second.
- **Supported types:** png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg, mp4, mov, webm. Anything
  else is refused up front. Images cap at 10 MB; our WebP shots are kilobytes.
- Every run **re-uploads** — editing the body a second time mints new asset
  URLs. Harmless, but don't expect the old URLs back.
- The same flag works on `gh pr create`, `gh pr comment`, and the `gh issue`
  equivalents, so a follow-up screenshot can go in a comment instead.

## Step 7 — Clean up

`.pr-screenshots/` is gitignored, but confirm `git status` is clean before
committing. Nothing from this flow belongs in a commit.
